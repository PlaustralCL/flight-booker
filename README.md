# Flight Booker

## Description
A detailed description of the project is on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).
The main goal of the project was to practice Rails associations, drop down
selections, radio buttons, and nested forms.

## Relfection
The trickiest part was getting the Booking model to accept Passenger information
using field_for in the form.
